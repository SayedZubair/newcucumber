what is cucumber
to create a cucmber framework or to use we need a mavon project then in pom.xml we need to add independcies

in cucuber we have feature files and step difination

what do we write in feature file? the user story
bdd, behavorial driven testing mean we test the applicatin as the application behave or a user will behave or approach
to the applcation
this the gherkin keys and terms  https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/

internet copy
GIVEN: Sets the context. What page are we on and what state are we in? Is the user an admin? Signed-in? Has created a campaign?
WHEN: What actions the user is performing. What event occurred?
THEN: What should the system do in response? What is the expected outcome?

mooazam
Given- pre condition
When->Actions
Then->Verification

Scenario
Given One thing
Given Another thing
Given yet another Thing
When i open my eyes
Then I should see something
Then I shoulld not see something else

Scenario2
Given One thing
Given Another thing
Given yet another Thing
When i open my eyes
Then I should see something
Then I shoulld not see something else

But we can use in this case
the login button display but not clickable


Step defination
@given(" one Thing ")
public Onething(){
}

Cucumber FrameWork

in frameWork we follow page Obeject model mean we have the following Packages

Utils  -- 1.common methods 2.constants(everything That we use in ourProject And we never change like implicit/Ex wait,path screenshot
or keyword or variable that we never change we add them in constant) 3. configReader4. Excel reader
Pages-->Login page , timelinepage(in face Book),profile page
Steps--test cases that are associated with login page--> login steps, timeline steps , profileSteps
Runner: smokeRunner
@RunWith(cucumber.class)
@cucumberOption(
feature=the path where is feature directory is "src/test/resources/features"
glue"steps"connects the step deffination package
DryRun=true  it will only scan for unimplemented steps

tags="@smoke" it run only the test case with this name
monochrome =true. It will remove the irrelevant information from the console
plugin[Pretty]==show steps in consol


)

for non java we create a directory called Resources
feature
Feature:TestTheLoginOffaceBook
Scenario:Login functionalty
Given user nevigates to the url"facebook Url"
when user enters the user name and password
and user clicks on login butten then user is logged in



config.properties---> its for configuration, all the information should be related to configuration like url
the brower to execute other info does not need to be there but it still we can keep the user name and password
browser
url
Data base Connection
BaseUrl
